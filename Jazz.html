<p>Jazz is a music genre that started in New Orleans, in the late 19th and early 20th century. African-American musical traditions merged with others and turned into jazz. Jazz is a combination of ragtime, marches, blues, and other kinds of music. Jazz was mostly for dancing at the start, but later people would sit and listen to it. Jazz evolved through  great musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, and Miles Davis. Jazz would later develop into different types such as traditional jazz, swing, jazz rock, and bebop. Jazz would then spread around the world and today jazz festivals and musicians can be found around the world. </p>
<p>The word jazz is believed to be related to <em>jasm</em>, a slang term back in the 1860s meaning &quot;pep, energy.&quot; The first use of the word was actually by a minor league baseball pitcher to describe a pitch he called it the jazz ball, &quot;because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it.&quot; Jazz is  hard to define, many musicians will say &quot;jazz is jazz&quot; or &quot;it's all music. One of the greatest jazz players of all time, Louis Armstrong, said &quot;If you have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know.&quot;</p>
<p>Jazz is definitely still alive to this day, and now has a bunch of different types. Some people believe that jazz is dead, while others believe that jazz is just changing and being modernized. There are still festivals around the world to help keep jazz alive and show its importance in the music industry.</p>
